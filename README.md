# GPA Calculator
This code calculates the grading point average (GPA) of a student based on the marks they have obtained in a number of subjects and the credit hours of those subjects. The user is prompted to enter the total number of subjects, the names of the subjects, the credit hours of the subjects, and the marks obtained in each subject. The code then calculates the letter grade and grade point for each subject based on the marks obtained and stores them in a list. The code then calculates the GPA by multiplying the credit hours of each subject by its respective grade point and dividing the sum by the total number of credit hours. The code then displays the GPA and creates a file called "MyReport.txt" with a summary of the grades and GPA.
